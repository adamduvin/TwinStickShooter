Lofelt Studio | Haptic Feedback for Mobile
v1.1.0

This Asset Package includes everything you need to begin adding advanced haptic feedback to your mobile applications created with Unity. It consists of a few important parts:

- The Studio plug-in for Unity: This provides two new components, the “Haptic Source” and “Haptic Receiver”, to the Unity Editor. These components are assigned to game objects and the main camera, respectively, similar to how the “Audio Source” and “Audio Listener” are used for supporting game audio.

- Haptic Samples: To help you get started fast without needing to design any haptics first, the Asset includes a growing collection of free-to-use haptic clips with associated audio files covering use cases such as Application UX and game effects. You can drop these into your app and start experiencing haptics on your mobile device immediately.

- Demo: This is a project you can build for either iOS (iPhone) or Android which showcases the current functionality of this package, including switching haptic clips and changing voice priority.
